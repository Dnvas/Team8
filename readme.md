# Public Toilet Finder

Web based app allowing users to view locations of Public Toilets near them in the city of Bristol.
The app is designed for anyone who is in the city of Bristol, whether they are citizens or tourists to quickly find out where the closest public toilet to them is, to allow them to relieve themselves while being out and about in the city.

# Dataset
The data set that we have used for our project is this:

https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/public-toilets-community/information/?location=15,51.45136,-2.59764&basemap=jawg.streets

We have used the Bristol OpenData to give us access to the locations of all of the public toilets available throughout the city.
