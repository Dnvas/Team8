# Design

## Behavioural design
### Use Case Scenario 1
User would like to locate public toilets around *their specific location* e.g. they are outside but are in need.
 - They grant the app permission to use their current location in order to obtain results.


### Use Case 2
### Scenario
A user of a public toilet could have a certain type of need that they require in order to make their experience much better.
For example, someone who is in a wheelchair will need an accessible toilet, or a parent or carer who is trying to use the toilet for their child, would ideally need a toilet that has baby changing facilities. These people would need to be able to search for toilets in the city that offer these things.
- The user will need to have a option to filter their search of public toilets, to only include toilets that have the facilities that they desire, otherwise they will arrive at a toilet that is potentially inadequate for their needs.

### Use Case 3
Users which wish to do so (businesses, people looking to startup etc.) can view different properties of individual toilets e.g. disabled access, in a restaurant, difficulty to reach etc. Based on these and perhaps a measurement of traffic regarding said toilet, these types of users can utilise this information however needed for their business goals.
