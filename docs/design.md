# Design

## Behavioural design
### Use Case Scenario 1
User would like to locate public toilets around *their specific location* e.g. they are outside but are in need.
 - They grant the app permission to use their current location in order to obtain results.

### User Case Scenario 2
User doesn't share their location with app e.g. want to pre-plan journey and/or would prefer to not share their location in general.
 - Do not grant app permission to user location, enter addresses/ points of interest manually.

### Use Case 2
### Scenario
A user of a public toilet could have a certain type of need that they require in order to make their experience much better.
For example, someone who is in a wheelchair will need an accessible toilet, or a parent or carer who is trying to use the toilet for their child, would ideally need a toilet that has baby changing facilities. These people would need to be able to search for toilets in the city that offer these things.
- The user will need to have a option to filter their search of public toilets, to only include toilets that have the facilities that they desire, otherwise they will arrive at a toile that is potentially inadequate for their needs.
