# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Allow for the public, whether it be visitors or locals, of Bristol to efficiently relieve themselves whenever
outside by providing them with open data of **Public Toilets** around the city.

### Business benefits
Plethora of benefits in different fields:
 - Increased number of customers for businesses which have toilets open for the public.
 - Visitors from outside will be more likely to enjoy their stay and in turn return, improving economy.
 - Businesses without toilets may take the idea into consideration and implement such facilities if they see fit ( e.g. they are only business in local vicinity WITH a Public Toilet ).

### Options Considered
Other options may include manually entering facilities with the intention of asking each and every one - which would not be very pleasant *especially* if you are in dire need. 
Another example may be searching online, but the information obtained would most likely be very lackluster due to the lack of precision when supplying the user with exact locations in comparison to their own, directions, time taken etc. 

### Expected Risks
As expected, no project is without its drawbacks. Some risks include:
 - Due to the nature of the dataset being open data ( from Bristol City Council ), it will only be updated whenever it is officially updated by the government and so some locations may be missed out.
 - Some toilets may be unhygienic to different degrees which may disappoint visitors or worse - cause health problems.
 - Misuse of these facilities may happen as is inevitable due to them being open to the public.


## Project Scope
Our **Project Scope** is made up of the people utilising our service together with the tools used to develop it.

Actors:
 - Workers, Students, Public, Tourists
